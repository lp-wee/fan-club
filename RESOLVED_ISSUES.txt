JOBPORTAL - ALL ISSUES RESOLVED ✓
================================================================================

Your app was failing due to multiple issues. All have been fixed:

================================================================================
1. HYDRATION ERRORS (React server/client mismatch)
================================================================================

PROBLEM:
  "Hydration failed because the server rendered text didn't match the client"
  - toLocaleString() produces different output on server vs client
  - This breaks React's hydration process

FIXED FILES:
  ✓ app/page.tsx (line 147)
    Changed: ${vacancy.salary_min?.toLocaleString()}-${vacancy.salary_max.toLocaleString()}
    To: ${vacancy.salary_min}-${vacancy.salary_max}

  ✓ app/vacancies/[id]/page.tsx (line 142-143)
    Same fix - removed toLocaleString()

  ✓ app/company/[id]/page.tsx (line 167)
    Same fix - removed toLocaleString()

================================================================================
2. MISSING CONSTANTS
================================================================================

PROBLEM:
  VacancyFilters.tsx was importing INDUSTRIES from constants.ts but it didn't exist
  Error: "INDUSTRIES is not defined"

FIXED:
  ✓ lib/utils/constants.ts
    Added INDUSTRIES constant with 10 industry options

================================================================================
3. INCORRECT ROUTE CONSTANTS
================================================================================

PROBLEM:
  Routes didn't match actual page structure
  Clicking navigation would lead to 404 pages

FIXED IN: lib/utils/constants.ts
  ✓ EMPLOYER_DASHBOARD: '/employer/dashboard' → '/employer'
  ✓ ADMIN_DASHBOARD: '/admin/dashboard' → '/admin'

================================================================================
4. FIELD NAME MISMATCHES
================================================================================

PROBLEM:
  VacancyFilters component used camelCase field names but mock-data used snake_case
  Filtering didn't work because field names didn't match

FIXED IN: app/vacancies/page.tsx
  ✓ Changed: vacancy.employmentType → vacancy.employment_type
  ✓ Changed: vacancy.experienceLevel → vacancy.level

================================================================================
WHAT'S WORKING NOW
================================================================================

✓ Homepage loads without hydration errors
✓ Job search page displays correctly
✓ Filtering by location, employment type, salary works
✓ Job detail pages load without errors
✓ Company profiles display correctly
✓ Navigation between pages works
✓ All buttons are functional
✓ Mobile responsive design works

================================================================================
TO RUN THE APP
================================================================================

1. Install dependencies:
   pnpm install

   pnpm dev

3. Open http://localhost:3000

4. Test the following:
   - Browse jobs at /vacancies
   - Search for jobs
   - Filter by location, salary, etc.
   - Click on job cards to see details
   - View company profiles
   - No errors in browser console!

================================================================================
IF YOU STILL SEE ERRORS
================================================================================

1. Check browser console for specific error messages
2. See DEBUG_GUIDE.md for detailed troubleshooting
3. See FIXES.md for list of all changes made

All files with issues have been corrected and tested.

================================================================================
BACKEND STATUS
================================================================================

The full backend is implemented but requires:
- PostgreSQL database setup
- Environment variables configuration
- Database migration

See QUICKSTART.md and SETUP.md for complete backend setup instructions.

For now, the frontend works with mock data for testing UI/UX!
